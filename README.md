# Hotel Reservation Cancellation Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze hotel reservation cancellations to understand the factors influencing cancellations and derive insights to mitigate them. The analysis focuses on testing hypotheses related to pricing, waiting list lengths, and booking channels.

## Hypotheses
1. **More cancellations occur when prices are higher.**
   - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant correlation between hotel reservation cancellation rates and pricing.
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Higher room prices are positively correlated with increased cancellation rates.

2. **When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.**
   - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant correlation between waiting list length and hotel reservation cancellation rates.
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Longer waiting lists are positively correlated with increased cancellation rates.

3. **The majority of clients are coming from offline travel agents to make their reservations.**
   - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the proportion of hotel reservations made through offline travel agents compared to other booking channels.
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The majority of hotel reservations are made through offline travel agents compared to other booking channels.

## Data Analysis
The analysis involves examining historical data on hotel reservations, including booking channels, prices, waiting list lengths, and cancellation rates. Statistical techniques such as correlation analysis and hypothesis testing will be utilized to test the hypotheses and derive insights.

## Results
- **Hypothesis 1:** Analysis indicates a statistically significant positive correlation between higher room prices and increased cancellation rates.
- **Hypothesis 2:** The analysis reveals a statistically significant positive correlation between longer waiting list lengths and increased cancellation rates.
- **Hypothesis 3:** Contrary to the hypothesis, the majority of hotel reservations are not made through offline travel agents.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are proposed:
- Implement dynamic pricing strategies to minimize cancellations during periods of higher room prices.
- Monitor waiting list lengths and optimize operations to reduce wait times and improve customer satisfaction.
- Focus marketing efforts and partnerships towards online booking channels to maximize reservation volume and revenue.

## Conclusion
Hotel reservation cancellation analysis provides valuable insights into guest behavior and booking trends. By understanding the factors influencing cancellations, hotels can implement targeted strategies to minimize cancellations and optimize revenue.

## Limitations and Future Research
It's important to acknowledge the limitations of this analysis, including potential biases in the dataset and external factors not accounted for. Future research could explore additional variables influencing cancellation behavior and further refine strategies for mitigating cancellations in the hospitality industry.
